# Fliping-cards
In this project you can check the transition ,translate and perspective properties,which are very useful.
When you click over the card you'll see the work of those properties.
Yup!! here you'll also find the js beacause this helps us to add onclick event so that the properties work after click.
Events there are many of them you can use many event such as onclick,dblclick,onmouseenter,onmouseleave and onload etc.
Thanks!!! for your attention ðŸ˜Š
